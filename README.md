# FetchCast: Automatically download your favorite podcasts

This program depends on **feedparser** (a python module) and **Python 3**. The inspiration for this program was being able to run it periodically on my NAS to later watch the podcasts from any device on my network.

## How to run
1. Add your favorite feeds to `feeds.txt`
2. Run the script with: `./fetchcast`

## Known limitations
* It does not run on Windows

## Planned features
* Create a package for FreeNAS
* Command line arguments to replace `BRANGE` and `RANGE`
